Digital Garden? Mine is probably an overstuffed and lack of nutrients. Thus, thoughts are dried up and stay immobile in time. I cannot recall the last time somebody said something worth making some space for it in my head. 

The state of overflowing isn't just utterly loaded and stuck, but also a sensation of emptiness being squeezed out by irrelevant events and emotions - ones that are unhealthy for the mind. Such emptiness is the result of unprocessed thoughts and ideas.

I took up writing and have tried to configure a WordPress blog to my likings and realized that it has become more clunky to maintain over the years. Obviously I have no interest in adding another mental load to my already-too-occupied mind. 

I decided to stop and looked for something else. 

Discovering the concept of Digital Garden as a solution to publish my non-serious writing away from WordPress blogs was a learning curve. If anything it must be called, perhaps "moving towards minimalistic ways to achieve things."

It must be noted that I am hardly an advocate for Minimalism but rather the consequence of doing this might help me to actually focus on getting things out of my head.
