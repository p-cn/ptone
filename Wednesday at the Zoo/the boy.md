Ký ức đầu tiên của tôi về mẹ là khi bà đang đứng bên cạnh bờ vực trên con đường núi. Từ bên trong xe, tôi thấy bà ngắm nhìn bầu trời và khung cảnh được bao trùm bởi sương sớm phía dưới. Khi mẹ quay trở lại và thấy tôi đã tỉnh giấc, bà mỉm cười và thì thầm gì đó rồi lại kéo chiếc chăn phủ lên vai tôi trở lại giấc ngủ. Lúc đó tôi mới sáu tuổi.

Khi chúng tôi về đến toà nhà, mẹ đi đến chỗ người đàn ông 

The first memory I have is of my mother standing by the cliff road. I watched her from inside the car as she gazed at the sky and the landscape cloaked in morning fog below. When she returned to the car and saw I was awake, her face brightened slightly. She whispered something softly and pulled the blanket up over my shoulder. I was six then.

After we arrived at our building, she walked over to the concierge and handed him the keys. I asked if Dad was still upset. She smiled and said he wouldn’t be with us anymore. We didn’t go up to our apartment. Instead, she led me to the bus stop across the street. As we settled on the bus, I looked back at our windows, wondering if Dad was in his study or if he’d step out onto the balcony and see us. He never did.

Years later, I saw my dad again in the city square, sitting in the front row as a sponsor for some event. For a moment, our eyes met, but he quickly looked away and didn’t return. I wondered if he didn’t recognize me or if he no longer cared for a boy that *wasn't his child* anymore. Part of me wanted to tell him that Mother had died, as any decent person might. But I convinced myself he didn’t deserve to know.

I cremated my mother as she wished and scattered her ashes on that cliff. I never understood why she chose that place. I visited the city one last time to see the zoo we had gone to every week when I was little.
