1. Your lowest points are yours alone. Others can't see them, especially if they want something from you.
2. Don't romanticize memories. Remember the disrespect that came with them.
3. Most people are transient. Move on without lingering.
4. Apologize immediately, genuinely, explicitly.
5. Choose your most frequent encounters wisely, such as your shoes, your bed, your best friends, and your job.
6. Sincerity and honesty are expensive. Reserve them for those who deserve them.
7. The quickest way to know somebody is to lend them money.
8. Decisions will upset you or others. Accept it. It won't change.
9. The weak fear the truth and resent those who speak it.
10. Life can be challenging despite our best efforts. It's not your fault for trying and sometimes falling short.
11. Behind obstacles and fears often lie what you need.
12. You think experience is overrated? Tell me how you will train then.
13. Emotional wounds hurt most when inflicted by those we trust. The only right course is to learn how to regain your sense of control.
14. People who obsess over you initially are in love with an idea, not you. They don't know the real you.
15. If problems only occur with certain people, it's them. Not you.
16. Self-obsession is tolerable. Forcing it on others is repulsive. This applies to everything - looks, morals, relationships, choices.
