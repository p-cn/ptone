1. Memories with some people might feel too good to leave behind. When that happens, remember the disrespect.
2. Some problems only happen when you are with certain people. It's them, not you.
3. Obsession with oneself is generally a benign choice, but to impose it on others is just unattractive. This can be about anything from appearance, morality, to relationship status and freedom of choice. 
4. Sincerity and honesty are expensive and hard to come by. Give them sparingly and selectively.
