While most of the space inside is filled with primal needs, what occurs to me on a daily basis is the piling up of processed information remains unclassified and unaccomplished conclusion. In the rare instance when an idea is transformed or decided, I feel a strange satisfaction. Closure is never easy, but when did I ever choose the easy way out?
