5. "If you wanted fair, you chose the wrong job, the wrong profession, the wrong species." 
6. "Perseverance does not equal worthiness."
8. "The most successful marriages are based on lies."
9. Khi đó, tôi không hiểu được sự mâu thuẫn trong bản chất con người, không biết trong sự chân thành có bao nhiêu giả tạo, trong cao thượng có bao nhiêu đê hèn, trong cái ác có bao nhiêu lòng nhân ái. Bây giờ tôi hoàn toàn hiểu rằng  chân thành và giả tạo, cao thượng và đê hèn, hận thù và tình yêu có thể cùng tồn tại trong một trái tim.
11. Chúng ta đang thờ Phật hay đang thờ dục vọng của riêng mình?
15. Những người tử tế nhất trong đám đông thường là những người đáng sợ nhất.
16. Mọi người đều sẵn sàng tin theo điều gì đó một cách mù quáng, như thể điều an toàn nhất trên đời là đứng về “số đông”.
17. Điều mà hầu hết mọi người trở thành không phải là người họ muốn trở thành mà là họ phải trở thành người như thế nào.
20. Người ta thà quan tâm đến chuyện cá nhân, ăn uống của một diễn viên điện ảnh dở tệ còn hơn là tìm hiểu thế giới nội tâm đầy sóng gió của một người bình thường.

 1. Những người trên thế giới này thật kỳ lạ, họ bắt những người muốn sống phải chết, sau đó lại thuyết phục những người muốn chết hãy sống tốt, nên ai cũng nửa sống nửa chết.
22. Bản chất xấu xa nhất của con người: ghét bạn vì có, cười nhạo bạn vì không có, khinh thường vì bạn nghèo và sợ vì bạn giàu. Khi người Trung Quốc gặp nhau lần đầu tiên, họ sẽ đánh giá thân phận và giá trị của nhau, sau đó lựa chọn, bạn quỳ vì người kia hay để người kia quỳ vì mình.
23. “Cái gì được coi là bắt nạt?” “Mười người bắt nạt một người được coi là bắt nạt, trăm người bắt nạt một người cũng là bắt nạt.” “Mười nghìn người thì sao?” "Đó là công lý."


26. Chúng ta không sẵn lòng khám phá giá trị của bản thân và đánh giá quá cao sự tham gia của người khác vào cuộc sống của mình. Vì vậy, sự cô đơn không còn đẹp đẽ nữa, và chúng ta cảm thấy lo lắng khi người khác rời đi.
27.  Tình dục là đời sống vật chất và tuân theo nguyên tắc khoái cảm. Tình yêu là đời sống tinh thần tuân theo những nguyên tắc lý tưởng. Hôn nhân là một đời sống xã hội và tuân theo nguyên tắc thực tế. Là ba điều hoàn toàn khác nhau.
28. Nếu nghĩ về lòng tự trọng khi yêu thì chỉ có thể có một lý do: Thực ra, bạn vẫn yêu chính mình nhất.
30. You will inevitably do things you don't enjoy. Use these as a way of getting closer to what you do enjoy as a process of elimination. If you don't realise what you don't like, its harder to realise what you do
31. Think about the first time you tried something that was difficult. Its probably not that hard now. This will apply to most things you do
32. Set up your team and work so that they don't "need" you! This way you free up more time to focus on the next thing. You are not as important as you think!
33. Your career is a story that you can sell. You can craft all of your experiences and skills around different narratives depending on what you want to do that
34. Be selective about where you work and put yourself in control of your job search by going after people and places that inspire you. 
35. Basically, manage your calendar. Block out time that is optimal for you to do certain things. People will learn over time to respect your time blocks.
36. Opinions of others are useful for understanding different perspectives. But they don't have to influence yours.
37. Doing lots of different things in your career can make you well rounded and lead to greater success than climbing a linear path.
38. You never know when you will need the support and backing of others. Give it others, esp those early in their career.
39. Don't overthink or over analyse. Do the thing if it interests you. Do it because you want to!

- ﻿﻿Tiến thân bằng thực lực sẽ cực kỳ chông gai.
- ﻿Vị sếp tốt thì sẽ ganh đua với sếp khác, sếp tồi thì so đo với member của mình.
- ﻿﻿Sếp tuyệt vời thì ko cần phải ganh đua, member sẽ làm điều đó thay sếp.
- ﻿﻿Thuyền chìm thì người biết bơi ko chết đuối, kinh tế suy thoái có năng lực thì ko thất nghiệp.

1. Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe.
2. Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points.
3. Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.
4. Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.
5. Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them “Is there more?”, until there is no more.
6. A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier.
7. Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at.
8. Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends.
9. Don’t trust all-purpose glue.
10. Never use a credit card for credit. The only kind of credit, or debt, that is acceptable is debt to acquire something whose exchange value is extremely likely to increase, like in a home. The exchange value of most things diminishes or vanishes the moment you purchase them. Don’t be in debt to losers.
11. Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.
12. Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence to be believed.
13. Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.
14. Rule of 3 in conversation. To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and once more. The third time’s answer is close to the truth.
15. Don’t be the best. Be the only.
16. Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.
17. Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works.
18. The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing.
19. Promptness is a sign of respect.
20. When you are young spend at least 6 months to one year living as poor as you can, owning as little as you possibly can, eating beans and rice in a tiny room or tent, to experience what your “worst” lifestyle might be. That way any time you have to risk something in the future you won’t be afraid of the worst case scenario.
21. The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested.
22. Optimize your generosity. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.
23. To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them.
24. The Golden Rule will never fail you. It is the foundation of all other virtues.
25. If you are looking for something in your house, and you finally find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it.
26. Saving money and investing money are both good habits. Small amounts of money invested regularly for many decades without deliberation is one path to wealth.
27. To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.
28. You can obsess about serving your customers/audience/clients, or you can obsess about beating the competition. Both work, but of the two, obsessing about your customers will take you further.
29. Show up. Keep showing up. Somebody successful said: 99% of success is just showing up.
30. Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement.
31. If you are not falling down occasionally, you are just coasting.
32. Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom.
33. Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat.
34. This is true: It’s hard to cheat an honest man.
35. You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.
36. Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison.
37. There is no limit on better. Talent is distributed unfairly, but there is no limit on how much we can improve what we start with.
38. Be prepared: When you are 90% done any large project (a house, a film, an event, an app) the rest of the myriad details will take a second 90% to complete.
39. When you die you take absolutely nothing with you except your reputation.
40. Before you are old, attend as many funerals as you can bear, and listen. Nobody talks about the departed’s achievements. The only thing people will remember is what kind of person you were while you were achieving.
41. For every dollar you spend purchasing something substantial, expect to pay a dollar in repairs, maintenance, or disposal by the end of its life.
42. Anything real begins with the fiction of what could be. Imagination is therefore the most potent force in the universe, and a skill you can get better at. It’s the one skill in life that benefits from ignoring what everyone else knows.
43. When crisis and disaster strike, don’t waste them. No problems, no progress.
44. On vacation go to the most remote place on your itinerary first, bypassing the cities. You’ll maximize the shock of otherness in the remote, and then later you’ll welcome the familiar comforts of a city on the way back.
45. When you get an invitation to do something in the future, ask yourself: would you accept this if it was scheduled for tomorrow? Not too many promises will pass that immediacy filter.
46. Don’t say anything about someone in email you would not be comfortable saying to them directly, because eventually they will read it.
47. If you desperately need a job, you are just another problem for a boss; if you can solve many of the problems the boss has right now, you are hired. To be hired, think like your boss.
48. Art is in what you leave out.
49. Acquiring things will rarely bring you deep satisfaction. But acquiring experiences will.
50. Rule of 7 in research. You can find out anything if you are willing to go seven levels. If the first source you ask doesn’t know, ask them who you should ask next, and so on down the line. If you are willing to go to the 7th source, you’ll almost always get your answer.
52. Don’t ever respond to a solicitation or a proposal on the phone. The urgency is a disguise.
53. When someone is nasty, rude, hateful, or mean with you, pretend they have a disease. That makes it easier to have empathy toward them which can soften the conflict.
54. Eliminating clutter makes room for your true treasures.
55. You really don’t want to be famous. Read the biography of any famous person.

58. Buying tools: Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.
59. Learn how to take a 20-minute power nap without embarrassment.
60. Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are passionate about. A better motto for most youth is “master something, anything”. Through mastery of one thing, you can drift towards extensions of that mastery that bring you more joy, and eventually discover where your bliss is.
61. I’m positive that in 100 years much of what I take to be true today will be proved to be wrong, maybe even embarrassingly wrong, and I try really hard to identify what it is that I am wrong about today.
62. Over the long term, the future is decided by optimists. To be an optimist you don’t have to ignore all the many problems we create; you just have to imagine improving our capacity to solve problems.
63. If he doesn't do anything to try to keep you why are you trying so hard stay.
64. Ask yourself this: "Do you really want to be loved like this for the rest of your life?"
65. i try so hard to help other people because i have no idea how to help myself.
